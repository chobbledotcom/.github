I'm a freelance Rails / Eleventy / Edge  / web / software developer and tech consultant from Prestwich, Manchester, UK.

My website is [chobble.com](https://chobble.com)

My big projects recently are:

I try and release everything I do as AGPLv3 - and this is the Github mirror of my main Git forge at [git.chobble.com](https://git.chobble.com)
